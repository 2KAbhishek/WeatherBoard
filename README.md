## What is this

WeatherBoard is a weather dashboard app, that tracks weather across different cities.

It is a web app, that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data. It has a simple and intuitive UI with support for adding and removing cities. It also has a chart that displays the weather data in a graphical format.

## Inspiration

Wanted to re-visit flask and try out bulma.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `python` and `pip`

## Getting WeatherBoard

To install WeatherBoard, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/WeatherBoard
cd WeatherBoard
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```

## How it was built

WeatherBoard was built using `flask`, `bulma`, `chartjs`, `sqlalchemy`

## Challenges faced

While building WeatherBoard the main challenges were setting up `pyenv`, finally found the solution using `pyenv global` and VSCode settings.

## What I learned

- Re-visited `flask` after a while and relearned a few things.
- Learned more about python environment management with `pyenv`.
- Got to try out bulma, pretty intuitive, want to use it in future projects.
- Also tried out `chartjs` along with other plotting libraries like `plotly`.
